    "A process reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to thier word stem or root.\n",

    " - Stemming/stemmed will be reduced to thier base word __Stem__\n",
    " - Electricity/electrical will be reduced to thier base word __Electr__\n",
    " - Berries/berry will be reduced to thier base word __Berri__\n",
    " - Connection/connected/connective will be reduced to thier base word __Connect__\n",

    " - Meanness/meaning will be reduced to thier base word __Mean__ which is not right \n",

    "Why Stemming?\n",

    " - Reduces the corpus of words the model is exposed to.\n",
    " - Explicitly correlates words with similar meaning.\n",

    "     - Grow/grew/growing will be using more memory space. Using stemming, we can reduce all three to its root word (which is __Grow__) thus saving us memory."
